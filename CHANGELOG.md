# Changelog

All notable changes to EnderSlicerCura are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-17

First stable release.

### Added

- EasyConical conical slicing: STL cone warp with G-code back-transform for
  tilted-nozzle 4-axis printers (OUTWARD cone direction).
- Support painting: per-region support enforcers/blockers with brush picking,
  transported to CuraEngine as modifier meshes.
- Thickness-adaptive walls: automatic wall reinforcement at tight bends via
  modifier volumes.
- CuraEngine upgraded to 5.14.0-alpha.0 with pinned Cura resources; engine-drift
  defaults seeded for imported flattened project definitions.
- Arc-overhang and wave-overhang engine paths (experimental, off by default),
  smart overhang strategy, and CurviSlicer non-planar slicing.
- Smart Infill workspace with offline filaSim thermal FEA (experimental).
- Settings-leak validation suite pinning that advanced features, when disabled,
  leave core Cura slicing untouched in both engine transports.
- Real Gradle wrapper (9.4.1); JVM unit tests now run on a clean checkout
  without the native engine, downloaded assets, or Rust/wasm-pack.

### Fixed

- Adaptive-wall modifier slabs extended 0.1 mm below the build plate (and above
  the gantry on full-height parts), tripping build-volume validation on every
  adaptive-walls slice.
- APK packaging could ship the x86-64 `libcura-formulae-engine.so` from a shared
  Conan cache; the AArch64 library is now selected by ELF machine and the build
  fails loudly when it is missing.
- Conical slicing: back-transform bed contact, Z radius computed against the
  correct centre axis, adhesion/priming handled per EasyConical requirements.

### Changed

- Conical INWARD cone direction disabled: its warp geometry dips below the
  build plate for any real model; persisted selections are coerced to OUTWARD.

### Known limitations

- Single printable model, single extruder; no duplicate/auto-arrange workflow.
- Smart Infill, thermal FEA, arc/wave overhangs and the smart overhang strategy
  are experimental and need broader physical print validation.
- Non-planar slicing buffers the full transformed G-code in memory; very large
  or dense prints may need a raised Java heap (see README).
